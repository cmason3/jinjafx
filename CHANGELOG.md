- Added support for `jinjafx.tabulate()` to produce GitHub Markdown style tables from `data.csv`

### [1.19.3] - April 22, 2024

### [1.19.2] - April 10, 2024

- Added an actual `CHANGELOG.md` instead of relying on GitHub Release history

### [1.19.1] - March 25, 2024
- Dropped support for Python 3.8
- Added support for using `vars.json` alongside `vars.yml`

### [1.18.7] - January 9, 2024
- Don't use a completely random nonce for `vaulty_encrypt` as it will potentially result in nonce re-use

- Renamed `ext_ansible_ipaddr.py` extension to `ext_ansible_netcommon.py`

### [1.18.5] - November 22, 2023
- Added support for `summarize_address_range` filter due to a lack of support in the Ansible `ipaddr` filter

### [1.18.4] - November 20, 2023
- Added support for `ipsort` filter which will sort a list of IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses into numerical order

### [1.18.2] - October 25, 2023

{{ jinjafx.counter('A.') }} Heading
{{ jinjafx.counter('A.A.') }} Heading
{{ jinjafx.counter('A.A.A.') }} Heading
{{ jinjafx.counter('A.A.A.') }} Heading
{{ jinjafx.counter('A.') }} Heading
```

Would result in the following:

```
1. Heading

```

- `jinjafx.counter()` keys are now case insensitive

### [1.18.0] - October 19, 2023
- Fixed an issue where a Jinja2 template could modify variables within `vars.yml` and the change would persist to subsequent data rows. This was fixed by performing a deep copy instead of a shallow copy before each data row is rendered - hopefully it doesn't have any unexpected consequences

- Python Type Hints (PEP484) have been added to core JinjaFx (`jinjafx.py` and `ext_jinjafx.py`) files and pass `strict` validation with `mypy`
- The Ansible extensions (`ext_ansible_core.py` and `ext_ansible_ipaddr.py`) have been updated so they pass `mypy` validation with `check-untyped-defs` but not `strict` as that is for Ansible upstream to update and then they will be incorporated into JinjaFx
- Fixed an issue where `hwaddr("linux")` wasn't working

### [1.15.4] - February 1, 2023

### [1.13.0] - August 17, 2022
- BREAKING CHANGE - `jinjafx.data` has reluctantly been changed from a list of lists to a function. This has been done to address memory issues with large datasets, where it doubled the memory requirements. Any occurrences of `jinjafx.data[row][col]` will now need to be replaced with `jinjafx.data(row, col)`, which should be functionally the same
- Massive performance improvements following the removal of `deepcopy` and profiling/optimising the code - using a large dataset, processing was improved from 104 seconds down to 8 seconds!
- Further memory reductions by ensuring data doesn't get duplicated multiple times while rows are being expanded
- Added support for `-var` command line argument to pass global Jinja2 variables on the command line
- Fields can now be designated as `:float` in `data.csv` to provide similar behaviour to using `:int`
